Application Ideas:
	* Actually interact with the inventory
	* Move the API to Azure
	* CI/CD process 
	* Deploy the Desktop App to Blob Storage for download
	* Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor?)
	* Web-based reporting
	* A Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register


Phase 2 Road map
1. Take advantage of .NET core (especially dependency injection )
2. Set up a simple task board in Azuure DevOps
3. CI/CD with Azure Devops (Move source code to Azure DevOps?)
4. Move the API to Azure.
5. Move the database to Azure SQL.
6. Deploy the desktop app to Azure Blob storage
7. Web-based Inventory system
